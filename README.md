this is a cpp adaptation to SamuelTulach's NULLMAP this is obviously patched. 
this was just for fun it does include a full library loader that should pass kernel callbacks.
thank you cracked5pider for letting me use yours for example, this project is multi threaded with 
shared memory(classes) for passing data.
